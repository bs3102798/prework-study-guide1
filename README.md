 Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For the reason of my motivation to complete this is to test myself and see what I am capable of. Some problems I had solve were the linking between the style sheet and JavaScript to HTML sheet but nevertheless I figured it out. For what I have learned is that it takes many steps and mistakes to do and finish a website.  

## Installation
